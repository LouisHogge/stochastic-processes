# Elements of Stochastic Processes Project: Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for detecting communities in a graph

## Project Description
The overall aim of the project is to develop an algorithm for solving the problem of detecting communities in a (large) graph. The system will be based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.
The project is divided into two parts. The first part of the project is designed to familiarize you with Markov chains and the MCMC method. The second part, which is the heart of the project, aims to put the MCMC method to practical use in solving the community detection problem.
